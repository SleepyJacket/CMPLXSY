## Option #4: Make art with CAs

 ### Flower Cellular Automata Art

This art was created by manipulating the variables used from the "Sandpile Simple" example from the Model Library of NetLogo.

The settings used was the 'setup-uniform 2' option while the 'drop-location' was set to be placed in the center.

As the run progresses, the difference from the reference CA art shows. 
The modified version depicted a circular floral pattern compared to the square design of the reference CA art. 
The color pallete was also changed to show a more floral aesthetic, closer to the flower of a Cherry Blossom.

### Weird Triangle Art 

This art was created through a combination of two different
rules of Elementary CA.

The upper half of the art is a triangular-shaped image which was
formed by a running a single setup of rule 99.

The run was paused midway, and the rule set was switched to rule 57 before resuming. 
The bottom half was formed, completing the triangle as well as featuring
a new pattern inside the triangle which looks like a prism.
